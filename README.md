# Embroider-Image-Transformation: Technological Overview

## Introduction

Want to make a brand, like everyone else.
The idea is to have everything as transparent as possible and making other people interested in the background of a company.
This includes production cost, margin, where the margin goes, fabric chosen, cost, production facility, fabric, everything you can imagine.
Everywhere I put thought into and have to make a decision I want the consumer to be able to understand how this works and maybe come up with their own ideas and brand.
Primary focus of this project is for me to learn how the clothing industry works and see if its also combinable with blockchain technology by integrating something like a RFID chip into the clothing piece.
This allows for very crazy ideas. One was to be able to track ownership of all clothes in the past but also what are the normal washing routines and in the future, washing machines could leverage this information and let you know incase you put in two clothing pieces that are uncompatible to seperate them and also takeover the entire process of choosing the best washing routine.


## Core Values

- **Learning**
- **Community Involvement**
- **Transparency**

Those three in any random order


## Core Technologies

### RFID Integration for Traceability

- **RFID Chips**: Embed RFID chips into each shirt, enabling comprehensive tracking of the garment's history, including its origin, manufacturing details, and previous ownership.
- **Consumer Insights**: Provide consumers with detailed information about their garment's lifecycle, accessible via a simple scan, including washing instructions and environmental impact.

### Machine Learning for Unique Designs (Side Project to learn about Computer Vision and also how to apply loss models to various constraints on a model.)

- **Abstract One-Line Paintings**: Train a model to represent a normal picture with one single line that has certain constraints
- **Reconstruction Loss Minimization**: Minimize the reconstruction loss, adhering to specific constraints such as stroke width, color palette, curve radius, and overlaps.
- **Design Refinement**: Probably some oversight and personal changes.

## Technological Relevance

Haven't found much of this technology yet. I think it's the future. Brainstorming

## Future Directions

- **Blockchain for Enhanced Transparency**: Explore the use of blockchain technology to document and verify each step of the supply chain.
- **Decentralized Design Selection**: Maybe Implement a decentralized voting system using Solidity for some extra learning.
